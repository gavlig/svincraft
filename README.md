# SvinCraft

![svincraft_header](https://github.com/gavlig/svincraft/blob/master/assets/readme/header.gif)

### A first person game prototype with mechanics inspired by StarCraft
Player can mine resources with hand-drill, spawn new npcs and give them move and resource mining commands.
There is also reaction to collision with environment for drill, visual indication of the amount of mined resources,
a little touch on drill animation when left mouse button is released and indication that mining capacity is full.


The purpose of the project was to see how fast a prototype can be made using only freely available assets,  
unmodified [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) and a number of plugins for it to achieve some sort of gameplay  
as fast as possible. (Before any polishing [this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIbebxN5p7U) was made in about 3 weeks of working in the evenings)
